# Learn the C programming language with me ðŸ˜„

#### This repo contains all of the code that I have been writing to learn C

- Every bit of code here, is inspired by the K&R book, which I have been using to learn C.

- Every file in this repo is independent of all the other files.

- The files are arranged chapter-wise for better clarity.

- I will be adding more as I learn.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamhrigved/learn-c.git ~/learn-c
cd ~/learn-c
source runc.sh
```

<b>Note:</b> It is recommended to source the `runc.sh` file and use its `runc` function to generate binaries.

#### Example

```bash
cd ~/learn-c/chapter-01
runc ./counting1.c # will generate the binary `chapter-01/counting1` and run it
```

OR

```bash
cd ~/learn-c
runc ./chapter-05/sort.c # will generate the binary `chapter-05/sort` and run it
```

#### Start leaning! ðŸ˜‰
